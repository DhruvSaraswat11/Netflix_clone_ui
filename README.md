Current Issue: UI Needs to Be Responsive
The current design of the Netflix Clone UI is not responsive, meaning it doesn’t adjust properly on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). If you're interested in helping with this, please raise an issue or submit a pull request with your proposed solution.
